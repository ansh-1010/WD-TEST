    <h1>Drone Technology</h1><br>
    <h2>What Is A Drone And UAV Technology
</h2>
<pre><big>Below we examine the science and drone technology behind the DJI Phantom UAV. 
We also have plenty of information on the latest drone technologies from the newest drones on the market.
</big></pre>
<pre><big>There are plenty of links, where you can read deeper into various components of drone technology.
For example, here is a terrific drone components overview article. 
This gives information on the individual components seen in most drones.</big>

<h2>Drone Types And Sizes
</h2>
<pre><big>UAV drones come in a wide variety of sizes, with the largest being mostly used for military purposes such as the Predator drone. 
The next in size are unmanned aircraft, which have fixed wings and require short runways. 
These are generally used to cover large sections of land, working in areas such as geographical surveying or to combat wildlife poaching.

<h2>VTOL Drones
</h2>
<pre><big>Next in size for drones are what is known as VTOL drones.
These are generally quadcopters but not all. VTOL drones can take off, fly, hover and land vertically.
The exact meaning of VTOL is “Vertical Take-Off and Landing”.

<h2>Radar Positioning & Return Home

</h2>
<pre><big> When the quadcopter is first switched on, it searches and detects GNSS satellites.
High end GNSS systems use Satellite Constellation technology. Basically, a satellite constellation is a group of satellites 
working together giving coordinated coverage and are synchronized,
so that they overlap well in coverage. Pass or coverage is the period in which a satellite is visible above the local horizon.

<h2>UAV Drone Propulsion Technology</h2>

<pre><big>The propulsion system (motors, electronic speed controllers and propellers) are the drone technology,
which move the UAV into the air and to fly in any direction or hover.
On a quadcopter, the motors and propellers work in pairs with 2 motors / propellers rotating clockwise (CW Propellers) and 2 motors rotating Counter Clockwise (CCW Propellers).

<h2>UAV Drone GNSS On Ground Station Remote Controller
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Signal that enough drone GNSS satellites have been detected and the drone is ready to fly
</li>
<li>Display the current position and location  of the drone in relation to the pilot
</li>
<li>Record the home point for ‘Return To Home’ safety feature
</li>
<li>Pilot initiated return to home by pressing button on Remote Controller or in an app
</li>
<li>A low battery level, where the UAV will fly automatically back to the home point
</li>
</ul>
